## Sample Project

This is a barebones project template for you to get started using Elixir.

The `src/` directory contains a couple lua files to give you an idea of how
things get compiled. Run `python build.py` and import the compiled model into
your game to have a look.

This should be enough to get you started using Elixir. If not, feel free to
submit an issue.
